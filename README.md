# TSDetect

A tool for detecting test smell 

Supporting **Java** and **Go** program(file ends with `.java` or `.go`). 

## How To Run

### Windows

1. Add your to-be-tested **Java** / **Go** `file` or `projects` into TSDetect/tests/resources

2. For **Java**, find **TSDetect/start-java.bat**.

   For **Go**, find **TSDetect/start-go.bat**.

3. Click start-*.bat

4. Then please wait patiently, if your codes are really huge, it may take some time to finish detecting(maybe).

5. You can find **your result** in **TSDetect/result/java** if you test **java** codes, **TSDetect/result/go** if **go** otherwise.

   The command line will also output prompts.
